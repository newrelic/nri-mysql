DefaultExcludedDatabases defines a list of database names that are excluded by default.
These databases are typically system databases in MySQL that are used for internal purposes
and typically do not require user interactions or modifications.

  - "mysql": This database contains the system user accounts and privileges information.
  - "information_schema": This database provides access to database metadata,
    i.e., data about data. It is read-only and is used for querying about database objects.
  - "performance_schema": This database provides performance-related data and metrics
    about server execution and resource usage. It is mainly used for monitoring purposes.
  - "sys": This database provides simplified views and functions for easier system
    administration and performance tuning.
  - "": The empty string is included because some queries may not be associated with
    any specific database. Including "" ensures that these undetermined or global queries
    are not incorrectly related to a specific user database.

Excluding these databases by default helps to prevent accidental modifications
and focuses system operations only on user-defined databases.
